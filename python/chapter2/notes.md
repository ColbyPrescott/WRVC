## Software Development Process
- **Analyze the problem**, exactly what problem is trying to be solved?
- **Determine specifications**, exactly what will the program do?
- **Create a design**
- **Implement the design**
- **Test / debug the program**
- **Maintain the program**, the program will continue to grow and evolve. The one part we don't really need to do in class

**Pseudo code** can be used to skip the mental overhead of programming syntax

**NameError** when the interpreter can't find the identifier

`for i in [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]:`
